# Fraud Detection Project

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. The project is implemented using Python and follows object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts for better code organization and modularity.

## Project Structure

- `fraud_detection.py`: Contains the `FraudDetection` class with methods for data processing, feature engineering, and model training.
- `main.py`: Script to run the fraud detection process using the `FraudDetection` class.
- `Fraud.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the fraud detection model.
- `README.md`: This file containing project details and instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Requirements

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
